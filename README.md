# Bike Ride Usage Analysis (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes bike ride usage data to understand customer behavior, demand trends,
ride patterns, and peak usage times using Power BI.

## Tools Used
- Power BI (Dashboarding & Visualization)
- Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
- DAX (Measures & Calculations)
- CSV Dataset Excel 

## Key Insights
- Total rides exceed 5.5 million
- Members generate higher ride volume than casual users
- Casual riders have longer average ride durations
- Electric bikes are used more frequently than classic bikes
- Ride demand shows clear peak hours during the day
- Behavioral differences indicate distinct usage intent between members and casual users

## Business Questions Addressed
- How does usage behavior differ between members and casual users?
- Which bike types are preferred by different user groups?
- How does ride duration behavior differ by user type?
- 
## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning & transformation
- Feature extraction (date-time components)
- Analytical thinking
- Business-oriented data storytelling
- Dashboard design principles
- KPI design
- Behavioral segmentation analysis
- Insight communication
